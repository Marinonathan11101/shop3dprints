What is Req and Res? 

- Request (req)
The request object (req) contains all the information about the incoming request, such as:

	URL the user is trying to access (like /signup or /login)
	HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
	Body (data sent from the frontend, such as form data or JSON data)
	Query Parameters (e.g., ?name=John)
	Headers (metadata about the request, such as content type)


- Response (res)
The response object (res) is what you use to send data or a status back to the client. It can:

	Send data (like JSON)
	Send an HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request)
	Send an HTML page or redirect the user to another URL


HTTPS Requests:

GET: Retrieves data from the server 
POST: Sends data to the server, typically used to create resources. 
PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server.
DELETE: Deletes an existing resource on the server.
